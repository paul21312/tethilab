						<h4>Start of our Story</h4>
						<p>Tethy and I are already friends 4 years ago. 
						We've been hanging out before for fun and as friends. On October 19, 2019 
						we met again in my cousin's condo :). At first we were just talking and eating
						but I don’t know why but I suddenly hugged her. We watched a movie, hugged
						and kissed. I had no intention of kissing her but she’s just so cute and 
						attractive. We didn’t notice that it’s almost 10 PM and I panicked because
						Benilde's parking will close at 10 PM so I ran back to school to get the car. 
						I parked the car in Mcdo near the condo then I went back to the condo to get 
						her. We bought food again and took pictures before going home. I thought we’re 
						not going to talk again because of what happened but then I was lucky because we 
						still continued talking. I’m so happy to see her again and it is my first time 
						kissing her. </p>

						<p>One of our best date! This is our first kapitolyo together. I really love this kind
						of date. We bought many food and just ate as many as we can. It is also my first time
						eating Auntie Anne's which is now my favorite! thanks to tethy. </p>

						<h4>First effort</h4>
						<p>This is the day that I started to like her. It is sunday, my family and I went to church
						and mall. While eating at the mall I saw Bacsilog and the first thing that came into my mind is her because she likes bacon so much. I decided to buy her two orders of bacsilog because she eats a lot. I told her that I’m going to give her something and I’m happy that she got surprised. She told me that she never expected me to give her Bacsilog. It was my first effort for her to show her that I’m starting to like her.

						<h4>Tethy first time at my house!!</h4>
						<p>This day is very unexpected! I never thought that she would meet my family.
						That day there was a typhoon and it is really raining so hard. I decided to pick her in makati
						because I started caring about her. We're already near to her house but then she suddenly got jealous when I told her that dancers are really attractive to me. She thought that I still like my previous crush. She suddenly cried and I got nervous because it was the first time that she cried. I told her that I really like her and to prove it, I invited her to my house. It was very unexpected yet memorable.

						<h4>They day that I started courting her for real</h4>
						<p>This is the day that I’ve been waiting for because I love her and I want her 
						to be mine. We’re not yet “bati” that time but I still wanted to do it. I told
						her that at 3 PM i’ll be there and she didn’t know that I was preparing for her. 
						I went to greenwoods after lunch, bought flowers, printed pictures and all.
						With the help of my friend, Jamps, I finished it faster but I was late. I 
						thought that she wouldn't be coming anymore but gladly, she was just asleep.
						She’s finally walking and I’m really nervous because I don’t know what will 
						happen. She arrived and she didn't want to look back because she saw pictures 
						at the back when she looked at the mirror. I asked her “ will you be my 
						girlfriend” but I didn’t get an answer that day. It’s fine because It doesn't 
						stop me from courting her. Instead of feeling down, I said to myself that next 
						time I will do better. I really love her and I will do everything for her.</p>

						<h4>FIRST TAGAYTAY WITH TETHY AND MY FAM</h4>
						<p>Before this day, my mom suddenly invited teth to eat samgyup with our family. 
						It is very exciting because finally we’re bonding together with my family! We fetched 
						tethy at Sumilang, she’s very lovely and beautiful! We both thought that we’re just 
						going to eat at samgyup but my mom decided to eat at tagaytay. She told me that she’s 
						not ready and she doesn’t like her outfit. She’s complaining to me that she could’ve 
						dressed well if she knew. The way she said it was very cute. She never knew that in my
						eyes she’s perfect and always beautiful whatever she wears. I really love it when she 
						gets closer to my family. I love it when she smiles and plays with us. Someday I’ll 
						do the same but that time with her family. </p>

						<h4>FEBRUARY 7, 2020 BEST DAY OF MY LIFE :)</h4>
						<p>THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!! THIS IS THE DAY WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT 
						THE FEELINGS ARE FINALLY MUTUAL. The person that I like finally likes me too! 
						That was unexpected because we’re just having a normal day and it was very 
						unexpected. I just can’t stop smiling that day. I was very happy and I can’t 
						stop thinking about that moment. </p>

						<h4>I want her back</h4>
						<p>We stopped talking for 3 days and I just really miss her so much. I can’t 
						stop thinking of her and everything I do, I remember her. I’m really scared 
						and sad because she doesn’t reply anymore and I think that it is the end. I’m 
						just waiting for her, thinking if she’s safe, did she eat already? Did she eat
						on time? That’s the only thing that is on my mind the whole 3 days without her. 
						I finally decided to do something for us to be back. I created a poem, message and 
						pop up I love you for her. I don’t know how I can give it to her because she’s 
						not replying anymore so I talked to her friend, Nicole. I asked her if she could
						give it to her in the morning and I'm happy that she replied. I woke up late! 
						But I still went to CEU for her. I gave my efforts for teth to nicole and she
						put it in her desk. I thought that she would chat me for that but it's still not
						enough. Nicole asked me if I want to go and meet her and I said yes. I bought 
						flowers, find her and finally when I saw her, she accepted it! I’m scared that
						maybe she won’t accept it and just walk away but she’s just so kind :(. I hugged 
						her real tight, I missed her so bad. I’m really thankful for her friends that day. 
						I just realized that there are things we do for love. If you really want someone,
						you will do everything and anything for her. I love you teth!!!!!!!</p>

						<h4>Our last day together :(</h4>
						<p>We both know that this will be the last day that we’ll be able 
						to see each other. Community quarantine is called in our place because
						corona virus is now spreading. I really love that day because the way 
						she hugged me and kissed me makes me feel that I’m really special and 
						luckiest man in the world. I cherished every moment with her because we 
						never know when we will be able to see each other. Maybe weeks? Months?
						We enjoyed playing with my siblings and we ate dinner at my house. 
						I really miss her and I always pray for her safety. </p>

						<h4>To the person that I love the most</h4>
						<p>I just want to say that you mean the world to me and I love you so much. I love your smile,
			lips, eyes, body, the way you do cute things and everything about you. I just want you to stay
			in my life. I want to grow with you together, be strong together and grow old with you. I never
			wanted to hurt you. I'm sorry for everything that I did that hurted you. I just love you so much
			and I can’t imagine a world without you. I’m scared every time you say that you will leave me 
			because I just can't live without you anymore. You’re my sunshine and my coffee in the morning, 
			you make every morning special. You make me happy, you make me smile, you’ll never know baby how 
			much I love you. Please don’t take my sunshine away. Please always stay with me through thick and 
			thin. You’re the only one I need, the only one I want. Thank you for taking care of me and for 
			loving me. I appreciate everything that you did for me. You always take care of me anywhere and you 
			treat me well. You made me feel important. I’m very aware of your efforts and sacrifices. I’m forever 
			thankful and grateful that you came into my life. I never thought in my life that we will be in 
			this kind of relationship. Love is just unpredictable, it just suddenly appears. I’ve learned many 
			things from you and I want to learn more from you. I want to know you more and solve your puzzle. 
			As I said before you’re like a puzzle and I wanted to solve that puzzle of yours. I’m also a puzzle
			but the difference is you’re the missing piece in me for me to be complete. Thank you for listening
			to my stories and always being there for me. Thank you for the support, love and care. You’re always 
			in my mind and heart I love you my baby girl. You’re the only girl I will love and cherish for the 
			rest of my life. I love you, rosette</p>
